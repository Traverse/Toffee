# Toffee

Toffee is a customizable LAMP stack that uses `Vagrant`. I've borrowed heavily from [Vaprobash](https://github.com/fideloper/Vaprobash/), some provisioning scripts are unaltered some are tweaked/modified so credit goes to [Fideloper](https://github.com/fideloper/) for giving me an amazing starting point.

All the configuration settings can be found in the `Vagrantfile`

***Any suggestions are welcome!***


***TODO:***
