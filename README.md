# Basic Vagrant LAMP stack

A basic Vagrant LAMP stack using a shellscript to provision the VM.

Installs Apache, PHP, MySQL, PHPMyAdmin and sets up an empty database.

Most configurations are done using variables in both the Vagrantfile and bootstrap.sh so if you want to change settings you only have to change the variables.

TODO: Set up xdebug during provisioning.
